# Speck-Assay-Automated-Workflow
Project working on the creation of an automated pipeline to process and analyse Speck Asssay data

Specifically, we developed a R-based program for automated gating and analysis of ASC speck percentage at different levels of NLRP3 expression. The program then calculates the amount of NLRP3 that is required to form ASC specks in 50% of the population (called EC50) and compares the EC50 values of NLRP3 variants to WT, which generates an EC50 ratio. We define ASC50 as the relative difference between the variant and WT.

This project aims to increase both processing speed and data reproducability by providing a standardised analysis pipeline capable of processing data from raw FCS files.
